# Chitti & Sana — Frontend

A friendly, responsive React app that teaches 6th graders how computers feel the
*vibe* of a sentence. Kids can try two approaches:

- **Lexicon** (rule-based)
- **Signals** (kid-friendly heuristics: emojis, `!`, boosters like “very”, and the part after “but”)

The app also includes a short **Quiz** and a **Recent Scores** leaderboard.
